    <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>

    <p>
        In HTML, extra spaces and line breaks are usually ignored. You can use the &lt;br&gt; tag to force a line break.<br>
        For example, this sentence<br>is split across<br>multiple lines.
    </p>

    <p>
        Multiple        spaces         in         HTML         are         rendered         as         a         single         space.
    </p>

    <p>
        To preserve white space exactly as typed, use the &lt;pre&gt; tag:<br>
        <pre>Multiple        spaces         and
line breaks
are preserved here.</pre>
    </p>
